# StudentMarkSorter Project

This project was a group submission for a university hackathon. The goal was to upload and process student data from a CSV file using Python and the Pandas library. The dataset included names and IDs, which we sorted by last name. We then identified the top five students in each module based on grades and visualized the results, including the performance of sorting and searching algorithms.
